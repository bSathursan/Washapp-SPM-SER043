## Project Description

**Washapp-SPM-SER043**
  Management made the decision to establish "Washapp," a laundry management system, for the benefit of the consumer. This system controls laundry-related 
services for customers and makes them easy to access through signups and log-ins (s). If this system is effectively handled, all cleaning services are constantly 
accessible to customers. A computerized laundry management system will benefit both the customer and the service provider. This online laundry management system aims 
to make management of laundry businesses easier by automating all processes and increasing its efficiency.
